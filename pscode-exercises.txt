// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Start
    Declare Integer a, b, sum
     Output "Sum of Two Numbers"
    Input a
    Input b
    Assign sum = a+b
    Output "The total sum of " & a & " and " & b & " is " & sum &"."
Stop

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Start
    take Number
    remainder=Number%2
    if remainder==0;
    print even
    else
    print odd
Stop

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

input n1, n2, n3, n4, n5

avg = (n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 + n5)/5

small = n1

large = n1

for i = 2 to 5:

   if n1 > ni then:

       small = ni

   if n1 < ni: then:

       large = ni

print("Average:", avg)

print("Smallest:", small)

print("Largest:", large)
